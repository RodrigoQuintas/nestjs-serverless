## Description

Just a test project with these tecnologies:
| Tecnology | Progress |
|---|---|
| Nestjs | OK |
| Servesless Framework | OK |
| AWS Lambda | OK |
| AWS SQS | Working |
| AWS Step Functions | OK |
##### My idea is run a nestjs projet inside a lambda function, calling SQS and a step function inside this lambda.

$ npm install
